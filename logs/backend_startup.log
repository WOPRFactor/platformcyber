ImportError: Plotly Express requires numpy to be installed. You can install numpy using pip with:

$ pip install numpy

Or install Plotly Express and its dependencies directly with:

$ pip install "plotly[express]"

You can also use Plotly Graph Objects to create a large number of charts without installing
numpy. See examples here: https://plotly.com/python/graph-objects/
